This file contains a write-up of two challenges from each domain

## General Skills

### fixme1.py

To edit the contents of the python program, we use the nano command. The indentation seems to be wrong. On fixing this, we can use the python3 command to run the fixed program and output the flag.

    nano fixme1.py
    python3 fixme1.py

Flag for the challenge:
    
    picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_6a476c8f}

### convertme.py

Using the python3 command, we can run the program. It asks us what is the binary equivalent of the decimal number 60. Using a convesion table, we see that 60 in decimal is 111100 in binary. Thus, we enter 111100 to get the flag

    python3 convertme.py

Flag for the challenge:
